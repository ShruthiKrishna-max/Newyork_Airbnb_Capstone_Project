##  Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an end-to-end data analysis on the **New York City Airbnb dataset**. The goal is to explore pricing trends, understand factors influencing rental prices, and gain meaningful insights through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

The project simulates a real-world analytics workflow and demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation using Python.

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains approximately **48,000 Airbnb listings** in New York City, including details such as:

- Listing name and host information  
- Neighborhood and geographical coordinates  
- Room type (Entire home, Private room, Shared room)  
- Price per night  
- Availability and number of reviews  
- Review frequency and activity  

The dataset required cleaning and preprocessing before analysis to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

---

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following steps were performed during data cleaning:

- Removed or filled missing values in important columns  
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format  
- Cleaned text-based fields such as host names  
- Ensured consistent data types across numerical columns  
- Removed unnecessary or redundant columns  

This process ensured the dataset was clean, reliable, and ready for analysis.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Several analyses and visualizations were performed to understand patterns in the data:

- Distribution of prices across different neighborhoods  
- Comparison of room types and their average prices  
- Relationship between number of reviews and listing popularity  
- Availability trends across boroughs  
- Correlation analysis between numerical features  

Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps were used to clearly present findings.

##  Key Insights

- **Manhattan** listings tend to have the highest average prices compared to other boroughs.
- **Entire homes/apartments** are significantly more expensive than private or shared rooms.
- Listings with higher review counts often indicate greater popularity and trust.
- Price distributions are right-skewed, with a small number of premium listings influencing averages.
- Availability varies significantly across neighborhoods, indicating seasonal or demand-based trends.
